# OncoImmu

This is to calculate neoantigen intrinsic features including amino acid descriptors(protFP, blosumIndice, cruciani Properties, FASGAI, MSWHIM, kidera Factor, stScales, T-scale, zScales, VHSE) and physical-chemical properties (aliphatic, auto-correlation, auto-covariance, Boman index, theoretical net charge, cross-covariance, hydrophobic moment, hydrophobicity, instability, molecular weight,Tiny, Small, Aliphatic, Aromatic, Non-polar, Polar, Charged, Basic, Acidic) in different positons of each neoantigen peptide.
