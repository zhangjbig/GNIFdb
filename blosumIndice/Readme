blosum Indice
BLOSUM Indices were derived of physicochemical properties that have been subjected to a VARIMAX analyses and an alignment matrix of the 20 natural AAs using the BLOSUM62 matrix.


Running blosum Indice

Before using blosum Indice, make sure that you have the R language and the R packages Peptides, doParallel, entropy, dplyr, readxl, stringr installed on your computer. If not, after installing R, run the following commands to install the dependencies in R respectively.

Install R Packages

`install.packages("doParallel")`
`install.packages("Peptides")`
`install.packages("dplyr")`
`install.packages("stringr")`
`install.packages("readxl")`
`install.packages("entropy")`

Run blosum Indice

Creat a working directory, e.g., ./working
Unzip the downloaded file in the working directory
Run blosum Indice:
path-to-Rscript blosum_calculate.R -i <Input file(csv)> -o <Working directory>

Parameters:

-i: A csv file with two columns. The first column is the sequence of neoantigen's WT Peptide, while the second column is the sequence of neoantigen's Mutant Peptide. Now only neoantigens with nine peptides and one site-specific mutation are supported for calculation. You can download the example data by clicking on the link above.
-o: Working directory. The folder's path which you put the unziped files in, and where the output files will be located.

Example:

/usr/bin/Rscript blosum_calculate.R -i example.csv -o /feature_calculate/
