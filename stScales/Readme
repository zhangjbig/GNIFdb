stScales
Structural topology scale (ST-scale) was recruited as a novel structural topological descriptor derived from principal component analysis on 827 structural variables of 167 amino acids. By applying the ST scale to the study of the Quantitative Sequence Activity Model (QSAM), it is believed to be able to extract information from 827 structural variables and related to their biological activity.


Running stScales

Before using stScales, make sure that you have the R language and the R packages Peptides, doParallel, entropy, dplyr, readxl, stringr installed on your computer. If not, after installing R, run the following commands to install the dependencies in R respectively.

Install R Packages

`install.packages("doParallel")`
`install.packages("Peptides")`
`install.packages("dplyr")`
`install.packages("stringr")`
`install.packages("readxl")`
`install.packages("entropy")`

Run stScales

Creat a working directory, e.g., ./working
Unzip the downloaded file in the working directory
Run stScales:
path-to-Rscript stscales_calculate.R -i <Input file(csv)> -o <Working directory>

Parameters:

-i: A csv file with two columns. The first column is the sequence of neoantigen's WT Peptide, while the second column is the sequence of neoantigen's Mutant Peptide. Now only neoantigens with nine peptides and one site-specific mutation are supported for calculation. You can download the example data by clicking on the link above.
-o: Working directory. The folder's path which you put the unziped files in, and where the output files will be located.

Example:

/usr/bin/Rscript stscales_calculate.R -i example.csv -o /feature_calculate/
